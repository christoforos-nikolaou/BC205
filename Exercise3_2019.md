Exercise 3: Encoding and Decoding Sequences with the Burrows Wheeler Transformation
For this exercise you will need to pair up with a colleague and split tasks in doing the following.

Part 1: Encoding
One of the two will create a short (~500w) message which he/she will strip from any notation and punctuation, quotation marks etc and will keep only **the characters in upper-case, full-stops and spaces**.
Then he/she will encode the text with his/hers implementation of the BWT, create the BWT of the message and send it to the colleague.
Notice that the receiver should only receive the transformed message alongside a note on the precedence of the three extra characters (space, full-stop and dollar for the end of the message)

Part 2:
The other part of the pair will need to implement the BWT decoding in order to decipher the message. 
His/her job will be to write the code of the BWT-decoding and translate the message.
