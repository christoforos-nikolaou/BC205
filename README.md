## 2018-2019 Academic Year
### We will be covering the following topics  

**1. Introduction to Algorithms: Types of Algorithms, Complexity and Iteration vs Recursion**  
  a. Finding the greatest common divisor of two integers  
  b. Calculating the Fibonacci series  
    
**2. Algorithmic Techniques: Brute Force vs Divide and Conquer, Binary Searches**  
  a. Sorting with Bubble Sort vs MergeSort  
  b. Solving a polynomial equation with Binary Search vs Newton-Raphson
    
**3. Sequence Analysis: Sequence Composition and the GC%, Counting k-mers in a sequence, Estimating o/e ratios of k-mers**   
  a. Finding the GC% of a sequence   
  b. Detecting regions in a sequence with extreme composition (based on a Z-score calculation)  
  c. Comparing sequences on the basis of their o/e k-mer ratios  
  
  **Exercise 1**: Outlier Detection in Sequences/Sequence Comparisons with Genomic Signatures  
    
**4. Motifs in Sequences I: Motif definition, Motif representation in PWM and PSSM, Motif Strength as Information Content**   
  a. Calculation of PWM and PSSM matrices from a set of motif instances   
  b. Calculation of motif strength as mean information content (Difference in Shannon Entropy)
  c. Locating motif instances in an unknown sequence based on a PWM or a PSSM
    
**5. Motifs in Sequences II: Motif Deduction, Greedy vs Randomized Approaches**   
  a. Estimating a motif from a set of sequences   
  b. Deduction of motifs through a randomized approach (Gibbs Sampling)  
  
  **Exercise 2**: Deduction of Sequence Motifs with Gibbs Sampling/Location of instances in an unknown sequence
  
**6. NGS Algorithms: Large-scale alignment and Genome-wide read mapping**   
  a. Heuristic approaches (BLAST, BLAT)   
  b. Alternative data structure approaches: Suffix Trees   
  c. Transformation approaches: Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)  
  
  **Exercise 3**: BWT encoding and decoding of a given sequence
   
 **7. Network Algorithms: Network Basics, Statistical Properties of Networks, Network Searches and Applications in NGS**   
  a. Estimating the scaling properties of a network through node-degree distributions   
  b. BFS and DFS for network analysis  
  c. Genome assembly and De Brujn Graphs
