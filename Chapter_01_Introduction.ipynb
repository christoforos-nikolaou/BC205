    "* How does the number of calculations scale with the size of the list N?\n",
    "  - For each element in the list we need N-1 comparisons\n",

    "  - We thus need (N-1)+(N-2)+(N-3)...+1 calculations\n",

    "* This means that as N increases, the number of calculations increases by N^2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brute Force Approaches\n",
    "* SimpleSort belongs to a type of algorithms that are called \"Exhaustive\" or \"Brute Force\".\n",
    "* This means that they proceed with a simple \"all out\" approach that attacks the problem directly, in the hope that it is not too complex and expecting that the mere \"force\" of computation can solve it.\n",
    "* Brute Force approaches work in a satisfactory way if the problem is not very complex.\n",
    "* However they can be problematic if the problem is not simple as we will see in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Big-O, O() notation\n",
    "* O()-notation is a means to express the complexity of an algorithm, in particular the way with which the number of calculation increases with the size of the input\n",
    "* O() is shown as a function of input size (n) depending on the way processing time scales with n.\n",
    "* For example SimpleSort is O(n^2) because as we saw it scales with n-quadratic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sorting Take #2: MergeSort\n",
    "* Instead of taking each element and checking if it is the smallest in a list of gradually decreasing length, MergeSort implements a different (and faster strategy)\n",
    "* It starts by **dividing** the list of numbers into two sublists and trying to sort these smaller lists before joining them back to the full list.\n",
    "* You can imagine consecutive splits that come down to sublists of (N=2) in which the sorting is trivial: We basically need to check which is the greater of two numbers.\n",
    "* The key in the process is to carefully implement the consecutive splits and then merging of the sublists (which gives the algorithm its name)\n",
    "* This is done with a clever use of **recursion**.\n",
