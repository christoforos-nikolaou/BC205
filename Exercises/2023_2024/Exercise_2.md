## Exercise II. Genomic Signatures

- Task 1: Obtain the first chromosome from the genomes of the following organisms: 
(*H. sapiens, M. musculus, R. norvegicus, D. melanogaster, C. elegans and S. cerevisiae*). The sequences need to be in fasta format or similar.
You may use the database of your choice but you are advised to opt for the [UCSC Table Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables).
- Task 2: Calculate a table of o/e 2-mer frequencies for a given sequence. Use mononucleotide frequencies as background. 
- Task 3: Calculate the Manhattan distance of the k-mer frequency for all sequence pairs
- Task 4: Return a table with the Manhattan distances alongside your code and a brief discussion of your results. 
Does the Distance table correspond to what you would expect in terms of distances between the species?
