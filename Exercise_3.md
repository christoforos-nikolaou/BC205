# BC205: Algorithms for Bioinformatics.

## Exercise III. Bacterial Origin of Replication

- Task 1: Download the genome sequences of the bacterial chromosomes for [E.coli](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yo7ce9yxq69zdn7/ecoli.fa) and [Staphylococcus aureus](https://www.dropbox.com/s/by1nrbtejiene1k/Staaur.fa)
- Task 2: Write a program that uses the deviations from Chargaff's 2nd Parity Rule to define the origin and terminus of DNA replication of the bacteria
- Task 3: Implement the program on the two genomes. You may use any approach you want and any choice of parameters you deem suitable
- Task 4: Discuss similarities or differences between the two genomes
